# DCK
DCK (**D**ashboard **C**onstruction **K**it) is a opinionated  way to build React-based applications.

It's being created with several key principles in mind to simplify lives of React developers. Here are it's main principles:

1. Boilerplate is boring. Everyone hates to write the same code again and again. We've got you covered. No more same-looking reducers and copy-pasting of action creators.

2. Typescript is awesome. TypeScript helps to catch a lot of stupid errors that usually are difficult to spot in ES5/ES6

3. Not a silver bullet. This is just another addon on a top of great tools which helps us to solve frequent problems. It's not designed to be 100% applicable for everyone, nor we are not claiming this particular framework is the best. It **works for us**.
